# Ambiguity and Disagreement in Abstract Meaning Representation

This repository contains the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs of pairs of interpretations of the ambigous sentences from the AmbiEnt dataset (https://github.com/alisawuffles/ambient). The graphs are automatically parsed using the SPRING AMR parser (https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/spring).

This data is referenced in the paper "Ambiguity and Disagreement in Abstract Meaning Representation" by Shira Wein, 2024.
